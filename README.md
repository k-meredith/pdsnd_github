### Bikeshare.py

### Description
Bikeshare.py allows users to filter and view various statistics from data provided by a Bikeshare company for three of its markets:

- Chicago
- Washington, D.C.
- New York City

Users are first prompted to select which city they would like to view data form, then how they would like to filter it. From there, the program will provide them with various statistics based on the users entry and hopefully provide some valuable insight!

### Files used

- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
Kyle Meredith wrote the code based upon a framework provided by Udacity.
